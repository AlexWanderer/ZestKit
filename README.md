# ZestKit

The 3rd tween library for Unity. Yes, you read that number correctly. First there was [GoKit](https://github.com/prime31/GoKit). Then there was [GoKitLite](https://github.com/prime31/GoKitLite). They each had their purpose. GoKit was insanely customizable and GoKitLite was insanely fast. ZestKit was designed to take the best of both of them and make it even better.



## NOTE: This is just an initial commit of ZestKit and it is not yet complete. There is no demo scene yet and the easy to use extension methods only cover Transform and Materials. More coming in the next week or so
